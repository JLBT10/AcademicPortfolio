# Foundation and Advanced Statistics for Machine Learning Unit

Two intensive learning units focusing on classical statistical modeling methods. The foundation part concentrates on discrete and continuous probability distribution, density functions, univariate linear regression and hypothesis testing.

The Advanced part of the learning module addresses advanced statistical methods including multivariate linear models, Analysis of Variance, Model Regularization methods (Lasso & Ridge), Model selection methods, Decision trees, bagging and boosting, Random Forests, Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis.

Semantic Web learning unit is all about the data formats and the technologies to enable it like RDF, N-3, Turtle, How to query these data using SPARQL, and how to expand the vocabulary using OWL ontology.

# Time Series Analysis

The file Elec-train.xlsx contains electricity consumption (kW) and outdoor air temperature for one building. 
These quantities are measured every 15 minutes, from 1/1/2010 1:15 to 2/16/2010 23:45. In addition, outdoor air temperature are available for 2/17/2010. The goal is to forecast electricity consumption (kW) for 2/17/2010.

Two forecasts should be returned, in one Excel file entitled YourName.xlsx, with exactly two columns (one columns per forecast) and 96 rows:

the first one without using outdoor temperature, 
the second one using outdoor temperature.
Of course, the goal is to get the best possible forecasting. So you have to test all the models we see during the course, to tune them and compare them correctly.

In addition to your forecast, you should also return a short reports (few pages), explaining how you have proceeded and containing the R codes you used.
